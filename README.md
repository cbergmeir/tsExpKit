This is the time series experimentation kit, an R package that has the aim to facilitate experiments with time series. It implements a lot of tasks common in the analysis of time series predictors, such as embedding and preprocessing, time series simulation, partitioning into training, test, and validation set. Also present are some functions for error calculation and analysis/visualization.
